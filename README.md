## Tutorials
#### Writing a first view
Run `py manage.py startapp blog` to create new app in your project
***
### view

```pycon
from django.shortcuts import render

def index(request):
    return render(request, 'blog/blog/templates/index.html')
```
Note: Before we can render the view, we should add the app name into `settings > [INSTALLED_APPS]` to override its templates directory.
```pycon
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    ...,
    'blog',
    ...,
]
```
Note: You can find and edit the app name in `apps.py`
***
### url

Step 1: Add the group url for your app in `project > urls.py`
<br>(In this case, our project is `blog`)
```pycon
...
from django.urls import include, path
...

urlpatterns = [
    ...,
    path(r'', include('blog.urls')),
    ...,
]
```
Step 2: Create new `urls.py` inside your app and add url for each view.
```pycon
from django.urls import path
from . import views

...

app_name = 'main'
urlpatterns = [
    ...
    path(r'', views.index, name='index'),
    ...,
]
```
